             <p>We all know how the algorithm works—the more you look at your phone, the more it will send compelling content to keep your eyes from looking away. It’s hard to break habits of checking TikTok or Instagram and constantly refreshing to see more, but it’s important to take time away for our mental and physical health. Parents can set a good example through their own virtual behavior.</p>
             
            <div id="apps">
                <h2>Tips for Parents: Healthy Social Media Use</h2>
                <p>1. Understand the apps. What was true two years ago is no longer the case. Download the apps yourself and understand how they work. The apps and their algorithm are stronger than our will, and understanding how they work can help parents create sensible limits. </p>
                <p>2. Understand that all social media is advertisement. This is not about the actual selling of goods but rather branding an image of one’s self. What we post on social media signals to others how we want to be perceived. Therefore, inherent in any social media post is an advertisement of one’s self, reinforced by the currency of likes and shares.  </p>
                <p>3. Create a media plan.</p>
                <p>4. Have an honest conversation. Talking to teens about social media is critical to protecting their mental health. Whether they’re about to download apps or have already created profiles, speak openly about the importance of protecting their privacy, the permanence of posting on the internet, and the signs of cyberbullying. And make sure it’s an ongoing conversation!  </p>
                <p>5. Listen to your teen. These conversations are two-way streets. Having an open ear to their thoughts and concerns about what they see online will help maintain an honest communication channel. Make sure your teen knows they can come to you with any questions. </p>
                <p>6. Model positive social media behavior. Your teens are still watching and learning from you, so try to model the behavior you want to see. Keep your presence positive, set time limits, and try not to scroll at the dinner table. </p>
                <p>7. Non-negotiable limits. We recommend that social media access be turned off during the school day, social media accounts should be made private, and devices are not in the bedroom at night.  </p>
