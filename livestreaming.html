        <h1>A guide to live streaming</h1>
        <p>Live streaming has become a popular feature of many apps and platforms. By understanding why it is popular and what your child may come across, you can help your child have a more positive online experience.</p>
          <div class="content2">

            <div id="apps">
                <h2>What is live streaming?</h2>
           <p>Live streaming technology lets you watch, create and share videos in real time, a bit like live TV. All you need to be able to live stream is an internet enabled device, like a smart phone or tablet, and a platform (such as a website or app) to live stream from.</p>
           <p>Current popular live streaming apps include Facebook Live, Instagram Live stories, Twitch TV (often used by the gaming community), House Party and TikTok. </p>
           <p>Unlike pre-recorded videos that can be cut and edited, live streaming is just that – live and uncensored. </p>
           <p>Some live streams can be private. For example, video conferencing, like Skype or Zoom, uses live streaming technology to allow you to talk to people you have invited. To make sure they stay private, they should be password protected and passwords shouldn’t be shared with people you don’t know. </p>
         
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What are the concerns with live streaming?</h2>
            <p>There are several factors that can make watching or creating live streams potentially harmful for children and young people. </p>
            <p>Content. If they’re watching other people’s live streams, children could be exposed to age inappropriate content, including sexual or violent content. </p>
            <p>Offensive comments. If a young person’s live stream is open to the public, viewers may be able to leave negative or inappropriate comments on feeds. </p>
            <p>Live streaming is ‘in the moment’. Live streaming is ‘in the moment’ which increases the risk of children and young people acting on impulse. </p>
            <p>Do things they wouldn’t do offline. Children, like adults, can feel more confident when they are online as they feel protected by the screen. This can result in them saying or doing something they’d be less likely to do offline. </p>
            <p>Digital footprints. If a live streamer makes a mistake, shares personal details, or broadcasts offensive or inappropriate material, they are doing so in public. It’s possible for viewers to record a livestream, and it could be posted online or shared more widely.  </p>

            <p>Inappropriate contact. There can be hundreds, potentially thousands, of people watching a live stream, including people who might be looking to hurt or exploit children and young people. In order to manipulate children, these people may attempt to trick them into engaging in sexual activity, flatter them with positive comments or gifts, or make threats to try to force them to do things they don’t want to do. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>How you can help your child be safer while live streaming </h2>
            <p>Talk to them. The best way you can protect your child is to talk to them. Not just once, but have ongoing conversations as part of your family life. Having these discussions little and often is more effective than one big chat. </p>
            <p>Use devices in public spaces. As young people grow up, they often seek more privacy and autonomy in both their offline and online world. Younger children should be closely supervised by an adult and live streaming should not take place in a private space, like the bedroom or bathroom. </p>
            <p>Practice and prepare. Advise them to practice and prepare before they go live. This will minimise the risk of errors, or off-script activity. </p>
            <p>Privacy and safety settings. Go through the privacy and safety settings with your child. With younger children make sure only trusted friends and family they know offline  can view their online profiles and videos. </p>
            <p>Be wary of requests to chat in private. People who are seeking to harm children may try and move them from a public area of an app to a private area to have conversations that are likely to be less moderated. Remind your child to be wary of people they meet online who want to chat to them in private, away way from other people. </p>
            <p>Support and Reporting. It’s really important to make sure your child knows where to go for support if they need it, and how to report concerns. Remind them that they can always speak to you or an adult they trust if they are worried. Support them to identify trusted sources and organisations on the internet such as Brook, The Mix and Childline. </p>
